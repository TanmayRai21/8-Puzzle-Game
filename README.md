# Start The Game and Enjoy
I built this just to freshen up my basic vanilla javascript after a long busy placement season.

1. start the game.
2. click on any tile adjacent to empty tile to replace the clicked tile.
3. try to form the original picture shown at the beginning.
4. reshuffle any number of times, each time you recieve a random arrangement of tiles.
5. retry as many times as you can to finish the game in shortest time.
6. enjoy the game.
